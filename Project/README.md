# Investigating the Impact of Seasonal Monsoons on Ocean Stratification and Circulation in the Bay of Bengal

In this project, I will investigate the effects of seasonal monsoons on ocean stratification and circulation in the Bay of Bengal. Specifically, I will address the following science question:

**How do seasonal monsoons impact ocean stratification and circulation patterns in the Bay of Bengal?**

To investigate this question, I will construct a model of the Bay of Bengal and will run my model simulation for one year, focusing on the pre-monsoon season and the post-monsoon season. These two phases represent significant differences in rainfall and river discharge, which affect the freshwater input and, consequently, the stratification and circulation of the region. I anticipate that during the post-monsoon period, increased freshwater influx will lead to stronger vertical stratification and shallower mixed layers compared to the pre-monsoon period, where less freshwater inflow results in weaker stratification.

For initial conditions, I will use the state of the ECCO Version 5 Model in January of 2000. Similarly, I will construct boundary and external forcing conditions for this model from the ECCO Version 5 model output. To analyze the results, I will create a timeseries of temperature in the Bay of Bengal to observe the differences between the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season. For visualization, I will create a movie illustrating changes in stratification and circulation from pre-monsoon to post-monsoon seasons.
